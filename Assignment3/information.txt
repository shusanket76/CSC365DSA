The goal of this project is to applying association rule mining on the VAERS dataset. 
Consider the updated datasets attached and utilize your function you created in Task 1 in Project 1 to 
generate the complete dataset VAERSDataNov_23.csv with COVID 19 vaccine adverse effects as of November, 2023. 

Task 1:
Covert the VAERSDataNov_23.csv dataset into a transaction dataset , VAERSData_ML where each row contains the 
following information: VAERS_ID,VAX_MANU, RECVDATE, AGE_YRS, SEX, DIED, DATEDIED,VAX_DATE,  no_of_symptoms(k), 
symptom_1, symptom_2, ..., symptom_k

Task 2: Association Rule Mining 
Design and implement an algorithm to discover “association rules” on the VAERSData_ML dataset. You may try out 
different algorithms. Visualize the result you found. Report any interesting association rules discovered in the 
experiments and explain why they are interesting.

Task 3: Project report
Your project report should contain the following:
Theoretical Discussion: Limited to two pages discussing about data preprocessing steps, the motivation for 
selecting a particular method, and how the parameters are chosen.
Results: Include results of your experimentations.
Discussion and error analysis: Try to interpret the results of your model. Discuss intuitions or hypothesis that 
can be obtained by visual inspections of the resulting association rules. Mention about assumptions if any, discuss
 issues that might have affected the model’s performance.
